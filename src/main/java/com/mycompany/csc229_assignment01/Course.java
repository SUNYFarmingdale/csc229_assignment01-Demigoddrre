/*
* ToDo 01:
 Complete the followings:

The Course class should have:

    - ID 

    - Name

    - Code

 - You need to have setters and getters for all data members
 - You must have a default constructor and an overloaded one that accepts 3 parameters to update the member variables.

 - Using a driver class (with main), instantiate the Course class and call its methods to change the id, name, and code.

 - Test and run your code.

 - Add comments to explain your program.

 - Push the code to GitHub.

 - Submit the Github link here (make sure it is a public repo).
